//TODO Arthur & Laura > The table needs a method that map for every
//timeSlot, the start and end hour. Ex: MORNING_1 -> (start: 7:30, end: 9:10).
// You should use this method with the scheduleDataToOutput

//TODO Arthur & Laura -> The table also needs a method that gets the resoult of the
// method above with the dayPattern and checks if the current day and hour matches with some schedule.
// Should return true if matches or false otherwise. This method should be used on
// the last column('status'), so true will render the green ball and false will render
// the red one.
